# `sat_toasty_helper` is a convenient way to write and solve SAT constraints in Rust

Currently, `sat_toasty_helper` relies on [`splr`](https://crates.io/crates/splr), a modern SAT solver written in Rust.

In the future, I hope to make this part more configurable - but for the initial release, it's provided to give the best "batteries-included" experience for initial setup.

This is a very WIP project; I'm gradually cleaning up and publishing pieces of the utilities I've built for setting and solving pen-and-paper puzzles.
